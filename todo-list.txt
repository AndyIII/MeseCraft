#### URGENT PRIORITY ####
Exploit (Material duplication): Nether portal is exploitable for infinite portal-materials if a magic_mirror is used. Break exit portal, mirror home, then reinitiate portal entrance.
Mobs are flashing on hit. Need to look into the API to see why this is.

#### HIGHER PRIORITY ####

#### LOWER PRIORITY ####
Add particles that go towards void chest.

### IDEAS ####
Implement stargate-like portal with nether portal_api?
