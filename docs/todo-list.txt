################################## URGENT PRIORITY ##################################
-- figure out ambience vs music_modpack conflict
-- lib_trm, every tool now has level and usage, only supported ones should.
-- Readjust mob spawning parameters to be more aggressive and common for some.
-- Etheral content conseratively add.
Exploit (Material duplication): Nether portal is exploitable for infinite portal-materials if a  magic_mirror is used. Break exit portal, mirror home, then reinitiate portal entrance.
	-- moon rock needed to make moon portals? 
	-- teleporter node needed to make mars portal?
Death_compass can be duplicated somehow (reported by noodles) also does not work now.
Mobs are flashing on hit. Need to look into the API to see why this is. (TenPlus1 said this is because of the current MT version, should resolve in the next engine verison)
gramophone top part disappears when pickedup.
bee hives arent protection-compatbile.
fridges aren't protected.

################################## HIGHER PRIORITY ##################################
add coins (plat, gold, silver, copper) as drops from mobs. NPCs can trade in these coins.
Make ovens compatible with other food items.
Split mobs_creatures and create dfcaverns_mobs to be shared with FaceDeer's dfcaverns modpack.
fire-imps do not fly in lava, they do not float.
unknown items in lootchests underground. (probably due to dependency set wrong)
shift+click doesnt work on lootchests
Armor: add cosmetic slots vs actual slots to use with costumes and skins.
"3d_armor" on death, armor peices have a chance of being completely destroyed.
-- healing potion and hbhunger or hudbars seems to conflict and potion has no effect.

################################## LOWER PRIORITY ##################################
add steel sound to ingot piles when walking on it.
why is there a steel bar *and* and steel rod?
Change the "settlements" bell to be 2d of good quality.
converge papyrus stuff into a single papyrus stuff mod.
"drinks" mod makes eating noise instead of sipping noise. (share sounds with "thirsty"?).
lightning flash can happen in space, lower effect to just earth height.
Laxative to make player poop (like in pooper mod)
drawer upgrades
burnable: chairs, benches, tables, chests, apple wood planks, etc..
add doors with mesecons support to ts_furniture? (ethereal)


################################## IDEAS ##################################
implement invasions: goblins, aliens, doom, pirate,
Implement stargate-like portal with nether portal_api?
RPG Skills mechanics like McMMO?
Terraria-like Pet spawners  (e.g. dog whistle)?
Mining helmet, spawn wielded light above player when wearing.
leather more uses for leather: armor, maybe canteen.

UNSORTED
-- Improve wolf/dog following code.
-- add pets: baby dino, baby slime, dog, cat, etc that follow and help players.
-- Drop farming_redo, implement "crops", fix critical bugs, add compatibility for fruittoosl, drinks, and diet?
	-- After crops is implemented, rain ABM's can grow crops and grass, wash out footprints.
	-- change blueberry respawn rate
	-- Add weeds to crops (use nettles and ABM)
-- mobs_mc: add squid and use horse/armor in creatures.
-- add chandiler recipe.
-- are toolrank sounds missing when break-warning?
-- flying potion, faster potions
-- AFK mod should detect when players send shout messages. 
-- blueberries too much, diet mod. oats remove, cave wheat and such longer grow time.
